        <h2>Early History</h2>
        Though our discussion is entitled "The
        History of Artificial Intelligence", in
        fact we are focusing here on one brief
        but highly significant moment in that
        history , the moment when art metamorphosed itsel f into science, from wish and
        dream to something lik e reality . As you
        wil l learn from each of the discussants,
        this metamorphosis took place at several
        locations during the early to mid-1950s,
        and it s catalyst was the recognition that
        the computer was the most promising medium yet in which to realize what had been
        a human dream since earlies t times, the
        creation of man-made, rather than begotten
        intelligence.
        Let me remind you of some of the firs t
        manifestations of that dream. A great
        many artificia l intelligences , or automat a, appear in Greek mythology, put together to be useful or to carry out some
        task that the gods themselves find burdensome.
        Around 850 B.C., Homer tell s us about
        poor old ugly Hephaestus, the god of fir e
        and the divine smith, who, because he is
        crippled, has to fashion attendants to
        help him walk and assist him in his forgei
        These are golden, and in appearance
        lik e living young women.
        There is intelligence in their hearts,
        and there is speech in them
        and strength, and from the immortal
        gods they have learned how to do
        things.
        From the immortal gods they have learned
        how to do things. There's a phrase so
        fraught with implications it takes your
        breath away. For humans to behave lik e
        gods--because godlike it is to imbue the
        inanimate with animation--is hubris indeed, and no opponent of artificia l intelligence has failed to express shock at
        the blasphemous behavior of humans who
        aspire to divinity

        <h2>Applications</h2>
        AI is relevant to any intellectual task.[192] Modern artificial intelligence techniques are pervasive[193] and are too numerous to list here. Frequently, when a technique reaches mainstream use, it is no longer considered artificial intelligence; this phenomenon is described as the AI effect.[194]

High-profile examples of AI include autonomous vehicles (such as drones and self-driving cars), medical diagnosis, creating art (such as poetry), proving mathematical theorems, playing games (such as Chess or Go), search engines (such as Google Search), online assistants (such as Siri), image recognition in photographs, spam filtering, predicting flight delays,[195] prediction of judicial decisions,[196] targeting online advertisements, [192][197][198] and energy storage[199]

With social media sites overtaking TV as a source for news for young people and news organizations increasingly reliant on social media platforms for generating distribution,[200] major publishers now use artificial intelligence (AI) technology to post stories more effectively and generate higher volumes of traffic.[201]

AI can also produce Deepfakes, a content-altering technology. ZDNet reports, "It presents something that did not actually occur," Though 88% of Americans believe Deepfakes can cause more harm than good, only 47% of them believe they can be targeted. The boom of election year also opens public discourse to threats of videos of falsified politician media.[202]

<h2>Ethical machines</h2>
Machines with intelligence have the potential to use their intelligence to prevent harm and minimize the risks; they may have the ability to use ethical reasoning to better choose their actions in the world. As such, there is a need for policy making to devise policies for and regulate artificial intelligence and robotics.[214] Research in this area includes machine ethics, artificial moral agents, friendly AI and discussion towards building a human rights framework is also in talks.[215]

Joseph Weizenbaum in Computer Power and Human Reason wrote that AI applications cannot, by definition, successfully simulate genuine human empathy and that the use of AI technology in fields such as customer service or psychotherapy[j] was deeply misguided. Weizenbaum was also bothered that AI researchers (and some philosophers) were willing to view the human mind as nothing more than a computer program (a position now known as computationalism). To Weizenbaum these points suggest that AI research devalues human life.[217]
